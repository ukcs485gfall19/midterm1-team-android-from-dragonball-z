<h3> Functions </h3>
<p>The app starts by displaying a screen to select which version of code you wish to view. We did this because of a rendering issue. Dr. Baker said this was OK to do.</p>
<ul>
  <li>'Tutorial App' shows the functionality created in the tutorial</li>
  <li>'Functional Component' has all functionality we added to what we kept from the tutorial.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>Tutorial App</h3>
<p>The tutorial primarily uses the options menu to select the overlays to render. You can select one at a time for a specific overlay or you can select all at once.</p>
<h3>Functional Component</h3>
<p>From the menu, the options are still there, but have no functionality, we have them for future reference.
The menu also has a 'home' button to take you to the functionality selection screen.
We also noticed a small constraints issue using the iphone 11 pro. The 'home' button was displayed too low. Please use the 11 pro max or the 11.</p>

<p>Core location is automatically started, it should ask for permission when you first open the app.</p>
<p>Notifications will enable when the user opens the menu and leaves for the first time. A reminder will be automatically scheduled for the first second of the next minute after the user leaves the options menu.</p>
<p>Manual pin dropping with a generalized renderer can be tested by going to the options menu and typing in a longitude and latitude. Lexington is approximately -84.5 Longitude, 38.02 Latitude.</p>
